            <p class="para">I would love to create a library space for the community focussed on visual culture, which compliments the important contributions of Stanley Arts to the area. I envision this to be a welcoming, contemplative space for everyone&mdash;across income brackets, generations, and backgrounds&mdash;to feel a sense of place, and to be in community. I&rsquo;d love to lean on the support and knowledge of Stanley Arts and local heritage groups to bringing this dream to life.</p>

            <p class="para">South Norwood is home to our much-adored Brutalist library on Lawrence Rd. (saved in 2021 by local campaigning). Due to brutal cuts, it is now only open two days a week, and long-term underfunding means the range of books has stayed quite similar to when I was a child.</p>
       
            <p class="para">The second closest thing I&rsquo;ve found to this project in the area is the Elizabeth James Art Gallery, which opened in 2017 and is sadly no longer in operation. (Differering from Elizabeth James Art Gallery, the space will not rely on B2C commerce as a funding stream [more information in section 5]. Despite this, I will try to get in touch with Elizabeth, as she’ll have lots of insights I could build upon.)</p>

            <blockquote class="quote">
               A good educational system should have three purposes: it should provide all who want to learn with access to available resources at any time in their lives; empower all who want to share what they know to find those who want to learn it from them; and, finally, furnish all who want to present an issue to the public with the opportunity to make their challenge known.

            <p class="para">Art and design has had such a positive impact on my life, raising my horizons from a very young age. With the support, encouragement, and guidance of many art teachers (in particular, those at Croydon School of Art), I was able to enter the digital design profession, in which I have been practising for 16+ years. I would like to make accessible the things I have learned to those outside formal art education, with learning pathways into formal study and/or mentoring to enter the industry, should they wish to pursue it. For this, it will be important to create an environment in which learning can take place.</p>
            <p class="para">South Norwood is a deprived area with compound disadvantages. There is a very strong class current running through many art and design disciplines and I would not seek to replicate exclusionary practices, be they social or material. A key goal will be to reach, inspire and elevate those who may share similar experiences of growing up in poverty, or in migrant communities.</p>

            <blockquote class="quote">South Norwood has a young and diverse population. It also has a relatively high unemployment rate, and a relatively high rate of working age residents claiming out-of-work benefits.</blockquote>

            <p class="para">In 2020, I co-created Islington Council's digital upskilling programme, a response to job losses and precarity due to the pandemic. For this, I provided 1-2-1 mentoring online, and helped compile free learning resources. I found the whole experience incredibly rewarding, and it made me aware how much interest there is in art and design guidance and mentoriship from those outside of the industry. I'm pleased to say we had lots of great feedback from the learners and I will source the outcomes and learnings from the course lead.</p>

               <p class="para">Art and design books are often prohibitively expensive, meaning access to them may only happen within formal design education or when already in the industry. The refernce library will first be populated by books I own, and ones I can source form my networks. For books I don't have but deem to be a good addition, I’ll write to each publisher, being specific about why I think it would benefit patrons.</p>

               Improving neighbourhoods is a cause close to my heart. When litter-picking in the area in 2021, I noticed more closely the typographic environments (signage, nameplates, shopfronts, A-boards, etc.). A sizeable amount of the commercial visual communication could be improved, and I&rsquo;ve been auditing them along with building an index of businesses on South Norwood&rsquo;s high street. I will have some concept work ready when approaching each owner, making these services visible to them:

            <p class="para">I was born in 1983 at Mayday Hospital and raised in South Norwood, spending most of my life here, and returning in 2020. I think everyone’s worlds got smaller during the pandemic and walking the same streets I grew up in made me reflect on what community means to me. My vision for South Norwood is of a high street people are proud of, feel part of, and take care of. A beautiful, urban market-town. I am biased, but there’s no place else like South Norwood.</p>
