            <p class="para">I would love to create a library space for the community focussed on visual culture, which compliments the important contributions of Stanley Arts to the area. I envision this to be a welcoming, contemplative space for everyone&mdash;across income brackets, generations, and backgrounds&mdash;to feel a sense of place, and to be in community. I&rsquo;d love to lean on the support and knowledge of Stanley Arts and local heritage groups to bringing this dream to life.</p>

            <p class="para">South Norwood is home to our much-adored Brutalist library on Lawrence Rd. (saved in 2021 by local campaigning). Due to brutal cuts, it is now only open two days a week, and long-term underfunding means the range of books has stayed quite similar to when I was a child. Croydon Library remains fantastic, but is a bus-ride away, and its underfunding is also clear.</p>
            <p class="para">Libraries are extremely important. Research from the National Literacy Trust reveals one in five children don&rsquo;t have a book of their own at home, with increasing cost of living to blame.</p>
            <p class="para">The second closest thing I&rsquo;ve found to this project in the area is the Elizabeth James Art Gallery, which opened in 2017 and is sadly no longer in operation.</p>

            <blockquote class="quote">
               A good educational system should have three purposes: it should provide all who want to learn with access to available resources at any time in their lives; empower all who want to share what they know to find those who want to learn it from them; and, finally, furnish all who want to present an issue to the public with the opportunity to make their challenge known.

            <p class="para">Art and design has had such a positive impact on my life, raising my horizons from a very young age. With the support, encouragement, and guidance of many art teachers (in particular, those at Croydon School of Art), I was able to enter the digital design profession, in which I have been practising for 16+ years.  I would like to make accessible the things I have learned over the years to those outside formal art education, with learning pathways into formal study and/or mentoring to enter the industry should they wish to pursue it. For this, it will be important to create an environment in which learning can take place.</p>
            <p class="para">South Norwood is a deprived area with compound disadvantages. There is a very strong class current running through many art and design disciplines and I would not seek to replicate exclusionary practices, be they social or material. A key goal will be to reach, inspire and elevate those who may share similar experiences of growing up in poverty, or in migrant communities. Not feeling entitled to the discipline's space is something I’d seek to correct, and I will lean on Frerian models of pedagogy to challenge the ‘deficit model’ of learning.</p>
